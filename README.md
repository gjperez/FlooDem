# FlooDem

This model computes flooded areas using the Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) model, requiring only the Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The scripts internally compute flow directions, river networks, and flooded areas based solely on the DEM. Additionally, the model provides various methods to address fill correction in flatter areas for better delineation of river networks. Designed for use with high-resolution DEMs (such as those obtained from LiDAR), the scripts also offer advanced options where "gauge" sites can be prescribed within the river network. This allows for the interpolation of water levels within the river network, which in turn enables the computation of resulting flooded areas. This approach enhances the accuracy and reliability of flood modeling, making it a valuable tool for flood risk assessment and management.
